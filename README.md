# Block2Project

The purpose of this repository is to provide a library of code resources for use in developing visual novel games. 
Many of these resources provide a template for traversing through a storyline and providing various path options. 
Included in this repository are also additional elements such as a start page with a menu, in-game menu template code, and file saving resources.
